# Figma design for Animal Shelter web application

We designed an Animal Shelter web page. Firstly, we added nav bar which allows you to see animals that are currently at the shelter. At the shelter, there are currently dogs, cats and birds. There is also About us section which allows you to read more about our shelter and people helping there. For now, we added two posts about dogs that are really adoptable at Bestie in Split. 
Our web application is called Animal Shelter - AS which also stands for AnÄ‘ela and Stela.
While hovering above icons in nav bar, they are changing, as well as Read more option in posts about animals.
